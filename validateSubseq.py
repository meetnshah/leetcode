# A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that arenâ€™t necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. 
# For instance, the numbers [1,3,4] form a subsequence of the array [1,2,3,4], and so do the numbers [2,4]. 
# Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.( [1],[2],[3],[4]and [1,2,3,4] are all valid subsequences of [1,2,3,4] )
# Sample Output
# array = [5,1,22,25,6,-1,8,10]
# subsequence = [1,6,-1,10]
# Answer: true

#     seqIdx = 0
#     arrIdx = 0
    
#     while arrIdx < len(arr) and seqIdx < len(seq):
#         if arr[arrIdx] == seq[seqIdx]:
#             seqIdx += 1
#         arrIdx += 1
#     return seqIdx == len(seq)
